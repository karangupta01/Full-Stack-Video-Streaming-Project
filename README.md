#Full Stack Video Streaming (POC Project)
<h2>Author - KARAN GUPTA</h2>
Our full-stack video streaming application is designed to offer a seamless and efficient video content delivery experience.
This project revolves around building a video streaming platform similar to YouTube, where users can upload and stream video content directly from our server.

**Backend:**
- Built using Node.js and Express.
- Uses the Multer middleware to handle file uploads, ensuring efficient parsing of multipart form data and safe storage of video files.
- Uploaded video files are stored on the server and processed using the FFMPEG library to convert them into streamable formats.
- FFMPEG enables adaptive streaming by creating multiple versions of the video in different resolutions and bitrates.

**Frontend:**
- Built using React, providing a fast and responsive user interface.
- Integrates a video player capable of handling adaptive streaming.
- Uses the streaming links generated by the backend to deliver video content dynamically based on the user’s network conditions.

**Key Features:**
- Efficient video upload and storage system.
- Adaptive streaming for optimal video quality across different network speeds.
- Scalable architecture with robust backend processing and a dynamic frontend interface.
- Multer middleware’s role in managing file uploads, ensuring safe and efficient video data handling.
- FFMPEG’s capability to transcode video files into formats suitable for streaming, enhancing user experience.

This application combines the power of Node.js, Express, React, FFMPEG, and Multer to create a robust video streaming platform, providing users with a smooth and adaptive streaming experience.
